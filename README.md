# The Solution App

This is solution for Schibsted frontend task

#### Few notes:
 - I decided to use vanillaJS as my goal was to keep this solution small (sometimes I missed typescript, less/sass etc, but I would do it again same way)
 - in order not to expand project witch unnecessary libraries I decided to create own css spinners, checkbox styles etc (they are of difficult beauty, but also don't fall under any licence terms)
 - only few tests were written, just as POC
 - only few comments appears in code, mostly in JSDoc form 

#### Ideas for improvement
- it would be nice if server would return article `date` as timestamp, not locale string like it works now
- add any framework (or not, frameworks needs to be keepted up to date, other way they can be a security risk)
- hire professional UI/UX designer
