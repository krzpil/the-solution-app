# The Solution App

This is solution for Schibsted frontend task

Few notes:
 - I decided to use vanillaJS as my goal was to keep this solution small (sometimes I missed typescript, less/sass etc, but I would do it again same way)
 - in order not to expand project witch unnecessary libraries I decided to create own css spinners, checkbox styles etc (they are of difficult beauty, but also don't fall under any licence terms)
 - only few tests were written, just as POC
 - only few comments appears in code, mostly in JSDoc form
